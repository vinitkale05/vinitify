Replace the placeholder sections (Tech Stack, Usage examples, badges, demo links) with project-specific information. If you want, I can:
- Customize this README with the exact tech stack and commands used in your repo,
- Add a demo badge and CI status (if you provide CI details),
- Generate CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE, and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE files next.
